* Getting started

This is a configuration for Emacs on Arch Linux running the development version of Emacs (26.0.5 as of writing)

** Configuring Emacs

To configure Emacs, the easiest is simply to clone this repository in
the =home= directory :

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  git clone https://gitlab.com/dickoa/.emacs.d ~
  #+END_SRC

And that's it! Opening Emacs will then do the magic!

** A note on the use of =org-mode= for literate configuration

The [[https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs][original idea]] is to embed configuration bits into an Org file
([[/init.org][init.org]]), which contains both code and explanations, making it a lot
easier to navigate and configure. Emacs, with the use of =org-babel=
is able to extract all configuration bits and assemble them in a
standard =init.el= file, and its compiled version =init.elc=. The
trick to make it work is that there is already an initial =init.el=
file provided with this repository, which does the job the first time
Emacs is loaded.

This file looks like that:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :eval no
(setq user-full-name "Ahmadou H. Dicko"
      user-mail-address "dicko.ahmadou at gmail dot com")

(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
(load custom-file)

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")
#+END_SRC


After this initial load, a function (=tangle-init=) ensures that a new
=init.el= is generated at every modification of =init.org= (precisely
every time =init.org= is saved).

- Emacs opened with a RMarkdown file (=.Rmd=), including YAML headers
  and R code chunks, with the help page of a function in the right
  window together with the R buffer at the bottom.
